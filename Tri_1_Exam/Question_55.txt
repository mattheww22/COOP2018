Algorithm:
check_fermat:

    get inputs of a, b, c and n from main
    proceed to check_fermat
    a = a ** n
    b = b ** n
    c = c ** n
    ab = a + b
    if ab = c print false
    if ab does not equal c, print true

main:

    print introduction
    get inputs of a, b, c and n from user
    if n is greater than 2, check_fermat
    if false
        print: "Holy smokes, Fermat was Wrong!"
    if true
        print "No, that doesn't work"
